# Uber Eats Restaurant Recommendation System

This project focuses on developing a **personalized restaurant recommendation system** to enhance user satisfaction by providing tailored dining options based on user preferences, restaurant ratings, and other key factors. With the rise of food delivery platforms, users face challenges in selecting the most suitable dining options due to overwhelming choices. This system aims to resolve such challenges by combining collaborative filtering, advanced deep learning models, and comprehensive data integration to offer accurate and user-centric recommendations.

The system not only identifies patterns in user behavior but also provides filtering options that allow users to discover restaurants and menu items matching their tastes, budget, and location. By leveraging cutting-edge machine learning techniques and merged datasets, it delivers a seamless and efficient user experience.

## Features
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Utilizes Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to analyze user preferences and suggest restaurants based on historical interactions and similar user behavior.
- **Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)**: Employs deep neural networks to uncover complex, non-linear relationships between users and restaurants, resulting in highly accurate and personalized recommendations.
- **Merged Datasets**: Combines restaurant-level and menu-level details, enabling richer filtering and providing users with granular insights into restaurant offerings.
- **Comprehensive Filtering**: Users can refine recommendations based on criteria like cuisine type, price range, geographical location, and specific menu items.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes advanced data handling techniques such as imputing missing values, encoding categorical data, and normalizing features for optimal model performance.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Achieves reliable recommendations with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.85, ensuring precision and user satisfaction.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Integrates real-time data and dynamic filtering to adapt recommendations to changing user preferences and contexts.
